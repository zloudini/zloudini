Here are a few projects I’ve worked on that showcase my technical skills and problem-solving ability:  

- [**PennSearch: Chord DHT and Distributed Search Engine**](https://github.com/zloudini/PennSearch-Chord-DHT)  
  Implemented a full Chord Distributed Hash Table (DHT) in C++ within the NS3 simulator, extended with a distributed search layer (PennSearch) supporting multi-keyword queries. Focused on consistency, scalability, and peer-to-peer resilience.  

- [**BookBase**](https://github.com/zloudini/BookBase)  
  Designed and implemented a database-backed book search and recommendation platform with keyword search, ranking, and gallery view. Built as part of a larger system design course, demonstrating database modeling and efficient query design.  

- **Quant Backtesting System (in progress)**  
  Developing a backtesting framework that combines momentum-based signals with sentiment analysis from earnings call transcripts to generate long/short trading strategies. Built with Python (pandas, NumPy, NLTK).
